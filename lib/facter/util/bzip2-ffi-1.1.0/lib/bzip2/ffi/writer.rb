    # {Writer} compresses and writes a bzip2 compressed stream or file. The
    # public instance methods of {Writer} are intended to be equivalent to those
    # of a standard `IO` object.
    #
    # Data can be written as a stream using {open} and {#write}. For example,
    # the following compresses lines read from standard input:
    #
    #     Bzip2::FFI::Writer.open(io_or_path) do |writer|
    #       ARGF.each_line do |line|
    #         writer.write(line)
    #       end
    #     end
    #
    # Alternatively, without passing a block to {open}:
    #
    #     writer = Bzip2::FFI::Writer.open(io_or_path)
    #     begin
    #       ARGF.each_line do |line|
    #         writer.write(line)
    #       end
    #     ensure
    #       writer.close
    #     end
    #
    # An entire bzip2 structure can be written in a single step using {write}:
    #
    #     Bzip2::FFI::Writer.write(io_or_path, 'Hello, World!')
    #
    # The {open} and {write} methods accept either an IO-like object or a file
    # path. IO-like objects must have a `#write` method. Paths can be given as
    # either a `String` or `Pathname`.
    #
    # No character conversion is performed when writing and compressing. The
    # {write} and {#write} methods compress the raw bytes from the given
    # `String` (using the encoding of the `String`).

        #                    repetitive, input data. If compression runs into
